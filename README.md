# -Emergency-Aid-Management-System
In this project, I developed the Emergency Aid Management System as part of my final assignment for the second semester. I implemented features like inventory tracking, order management, and supply handling using C++. The system streamlines the process of managing emergency aid supplies, ensuring that resources are efficiently tracked and available when needed. The files I uploaded demonstrate the functionality of the system, from monitoring inventory to processing orders and updating supply details.
